Based on real-life financial crises, the program allows users to experience operating and deal with unexpected risks that an electronic retail business may encounter.

You will start with a limited amount of budget, office space and electronic items available for sale. Later on, with the revenue you received from the sales, you can upgrade the office space and unlock an extra quantity and variety of products in your store. Calculate the costs incurred (employee salary, office expansion cost, etc.) carefully or go bankrupt.
