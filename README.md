# Retail-Simulation

Based on real-life financial crises, the program enables users to foresee unexpected risks in which an electronic retail business may encounter. In the application, users may load data, plot graphs, as well as add/delete electronic products available in the store to minimize errand costs but maximize profit.

You will start with a limited amount of budget, office space and electronic items available for sale. Later on, with the revenue you received from the sales, you can upgrade the office space and unlock extra quantity and variety of products in your store. Calculate the costs incurred (employee salary, office expansion cost, etc.) carefully or go bankrupt.
